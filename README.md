# Neo4jxLLM Workshop
Here are the notebooks that I am using to demo Neo4j x LLMs integration:
- Medical Sheet shows how to use LLM to create a Knowledge Graph from unstructured text.
- DevOps RAG shows how to create a Knowledge Graph - based RAG application using Vector chain (implicit relationships) and Cypher chain (explicit relationships).
- Legislation Example shows how KG can improve the retrieval part of a RAG app.
- H&M shows how to use Graph and Embeddings to build hyperpersonalised search, recommendations and emails on a retail dataset.
